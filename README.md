There are a few existing datasets available that might be useful for detecting components on a motherboard. Here are some links to check out:

OpenPCDet: https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet - This is an open-source project that provides a large-scale dataset for 3D object detection in point clouds, including objects like motherboards and their components.

Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tejasreddy/pc-component-detection - This dataset includes images of various computer components, including motherboards, CPUs, and graphics cards.

Labeled images on Google: You can also find labeled images of motherboard components on Google by using the search terms "motherboard component dataset" or "motherboard component images".

Remember, when using an existing dataset, be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully and ensure that you have permission to use the dataset for your specific project.
